## Running Tests

You understand how to read tests, now it's time to run the tests. We've made it
fairly easy. In the same terminal that you used to write `node tests.js` or
`node index.js` now, you just need to write `learn`. That's it! No matter what
the lab, our Learn command will figure out where you are and run the appropriate
tests and give you results.

Speaking of results... let's talk about how to read the results that tests give
you.

## Reading Results of Tests

If we run `learn` in our terminal right now, you'll get a bunch of failed tests.
It will look something like this:

**Output from running `learn` in Terminal**

```bash
> js-functions-lab@0.1.0 test /Users/mbenton/Desktop/curriculum-team/js-what-is-a-test-lab
> mocha -R mocha-multi --reporter-options spec=-,json=.results.json

  2) what-is-a-test
       Height
         is less than 40:

  3) what-is-a-test
       Message
         gives the name and height:

      at processImmediate (internal/timers.js:456:21)



npm ERR! Test failed.  See above for more details.
```

Let's break this down a bit. If you look at about a third of the way down the
output, you'll see a summary of how the tests went:

```bash
  0 passing (293ms)
  3 failing
```

That should be fairly obvious. You passed 0 tests and failed 3 tests. Not a
great start, but plenty of room for improvement. Let's see how we failed the
three tests.

```bash
1) what-is-a-test
       Name
         returns "Susan":

      Error: Expected 'Joe' to equal 'Susan'
      + expected - actual

      -Joe
      +Susan

      at assert (node_modules/expect/lib/assert.js:29:9)
      at Expectation.toEqual (node_modules/expect/lib/Expectation.js:81:30)
      at Context.<anonymous> (test/index-test.js:6:26)
      at processImmediate (internal/timers.js:456:21)

  2) what-is-a-test
       Height
         is less than 40:
     Error: Expected 74 to be less than 40
      at assert (node_modules/expect/lib/assert.js:29:9)
      at Expectation.toBeLessThan (node_modules/expect/lib/Expectation.js:156:28)
      at Context.<anonymous> (test/index-test.js:13:28)
      at processImmediate (internal/timers.js:456:21)

  3) what-is-a-test
       Message
         gives the name and height:
     Error: Expected ' is 74 inches tall' to include 'Joe'
      at assert (node_modules/expect/lib/assert.js:29:9)
      at Expectation.toInclude (node_modules/expect/lib/Expectation.js:215:28)
      at Context.<anonymous> (test/index-test.js:19:29)
      at processImmediate (internal/timers.js:456:21)
```

This is all three of the fails. If we break it down even further we can see just
the test for `name`:

```bash
1) what-is-a-test
       Name
         returns "Susan":

      Error: Expected 'Joe' to equal 'Susan'
      + expected - actual

      -Joe
      +Susan

      at assert (node_modules/expect/lib/assert.js:29:9)
      at Expectation.toEqual (node_modules/expect/lib/Expectation.js:81:30)
      at Context.<anonymous> (test/index-test.js:6:26)
      at processImmediate (internal/timers.js:456:21)
```

The tests expects `name` to return `"Susan"`. But if you look at the
`Error: Expected 'Joe' to equal 'Susan'` line you can see that it received `Joe`
and expected `Susan`. That makes sense! In our `index.js` file we have the
`name` variable equal `"Joe"`. If you change that line to be equal to `"Susan"`
and then run the tests again by typing `learn` in the command line you should
see progress!

```bash
what-is-a-test
    Name
      âœ“ returns "Susan"
    Height
      1) is less than 40
    Message
      2) gives the name and height


  1 passing (544ms)
  2 failing

  1) what-is-a-test
       Height
         is less than 40:
     Error: Expected 74 to be less than 40
      at assert (node_modules/expect/lib/assert.js:29:9)
      at Expectation.toBeLessThan (node_modules/expect/lib/Expectation.js:156:28)
      at Context.<anonymous> (test/index-test.js:13:28)
      at processImmediate (internal/timers.js:456:21)

  2) what-is-a-test
       Message
         gives the name and height:
     Error: Expected ' is 74 inches tall' to include 'Susan'
      at assert (node_modules/expect/lib/assert.js:29:9)
      at Expectation.toInclude (node_modules/expect/lib/Expectation.js:215:28)
      at Context.<anonymous> (test/index-test.js:19:29)
      at processImmediate (internal/timers.js:456:21)
```

Woot! You passed one. Now you can go ahead and try and pass all of the other
tests on your own.

### Common Errors

While you are solving the other tests you may come across a few errors. Let's go
over some common ones:

#### Expected Undefined

```bash
Error: Expected undefined to equal 'Susan'
```

That one says that it expected `undefined` to equal Susan. That makes no sense!
You didn't set the `name` variable to `undefined`. Why does it think that `name`
is equal to `undefined`? What that actually means is that the test couldn't find
the variable `name`. This can happen if you by accident rename the variable.
Taking a look at `index.js` I made this mistake: `var nae = "Susan"`. Whoops! If
I change that back to `name` everything works. :)

#### Unexpected Identifier

```bash
/Users/joe/Documents/Documents/flatiron/js-what-is-a-test-lab/index.js:2
vr name = "Susan"

Woah! So many words that make no sense. Don't worry though. The most important
line is the `SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier` line. What that means is you
have some sort of typo or syntax mistake, It could be a HUGE variety of things
but usually, JS will try and give you a hint. This time it's pointing to the `vr
name = "Susan"` line of code. Take a look and read _very carefully_. I
misspelled `var`. Whoops! If you fix that everything will work.

One note on this type of error is that it is sort of a catch-all. Tons and tons
of problems end in that sort of error message. Whenever you see it, be sure to
read over your code with a fine toothed comb...and you'll find the problem!

## Type Errors

On the second test, there is a chance you might see the following error:

```bash
1) what-is-a-test
       Height
         is less than 40:
     Error: The "actual" argument in expect(actual).toBeLessThan() must be a number
      at assert (node_modules/expect/lib/assert.js:29:9)
      at Expectation.toBeLessThan (node_modules/expect/lib/Expectation.js:156:28)
      at Context.<anonymous> (test/index-test.js:13:28)
      at processImmediate (internal/timers.js:456:21)
```

This error is slightly different than the last two. In this case, the test is giving us a unique message because it recognizes a problem. If we look at this test in `test/index-test.js`, we see this:

```js
  describe('Height', () => {
    it('is less than 40', () => {
      expect(index.height).toBeLessThan(40)
    })
  })
```

The word `"actual"` is no where to be found - `index.height` is what is being
tested. The test expects `index.height` to be less than `40`. The error message
is telling us that `index.height` **must be a number**. If you're seeing this,
make sure that you have set `index.height` to be equal to the **number** `40`,
not the **string** `"40"`. Ruby will interpret the value as a string due to the
quotation marks wrapping it.

## Conclusion

Once you have all three tests passing, run `learn submit` to register completion. Congratulations, you've solved your first tests! On to many more!
